# pythonProjects
The repository holds python projects including caesar cypher, ROT13 cypher, a hacking mini-game and more!


# Caesar Cipher
This method of encryption was created by Julius Caesar. It shifts letters over by a certain length. This length is called a key.
For example, if we had a key of three and we started with the letter A, the result would be D.
This gives our data an (outdated and simple) layer of privacy!

# Caesar Hacker
To counter the former project, this method of penetrations uses a brute force attack.
In the field of cryptography, a brute force attack tests for all of the possible outcomes in a certain circumstance.
The great thing about brute force attacks is that it does what humans can do in a fraction of the time.

# ROT13 Cipher
This is the simplest of all encryption methods because the key is fixed to thirteen spaces. 
In other words, A becomes N, B becomes 0, C becomes P, etc.
Due to its simplicity, it makes for a great project, and an even greater vulnerability for a legitimate hacker looking to interpret your secret messages.
This form of encryption is typically used for non-sensitive information such as spoilers or trivia answers.

# Vigenère Cipher
In contrast to ROT13 cipher, the Vigenère cipher is the most complicated of the four encryption processes. This form of encryption involves multiple keys for multiple letters. 
Here's an example: the key "CAT" would translate to a key of 2, 0 and 7, respectively.
For this reason, the Vigenère cipher is strong and is too big to brute-force.

## Do you listen to music while you code?

I do.

Check out what I was listening to while making these projects [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvZOMRGdY1w&t=13323s).
