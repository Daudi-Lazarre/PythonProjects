# pythonProjects
The repository holds python projects including caesar cypher, ROT13 cypher, a hacking mini-game and more!


# Caesar Cipher
This method of encryption was created by Julius Caesar. It shifts letters over by a certain length. This length is called a key.
For example, if we had a key of three and we started with the letter A, the result would be D.
This gives our data an (outdated and simple) layer of privacy!

# Caesar Hacker
To counter the former project, this method of penetrations uses a brute force attack.
In the field of cryptography, a brute force attack tests for all of the possible outcomes in a certain circumstance.
The great thing about brute force attacks is that it does what humans can do in a fraction of the time.

# Substitution Cipher
Similar to Caesar Cipher, Substitution cipher is another form of encryption - the main difference being the potential outcomes of encryption.
In this form of encryption, one letter is substituted for another letter. As a result, the letter A has 26 possible substitutions, B has 25, C has 24, and so on.
There are way too many keys for our computer to brute force this - even our caesar hacker program wouldn't work on it. However, this does not make the subsitution cipher program
infallible.

## Do you listen to music while you code?

I do.
