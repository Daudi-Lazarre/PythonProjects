# Caesar Hacker
In contrast to Caesar Cipher, this algorithm can hack messages encrypted by Caesar Cipher via a brute force attack.
A brute force attack is known in the cryptography field as a computer testing for multiple possible outcomes in a short amount of time.
In the context of Caesar Cipher, this means that the computer will test for all of the possible keys in an exponentially shorter time than we as humans can.


## How to run the program
To run a program, do the following:
+ Get an encrypted message from "CaesarCipher" or online
+ Download the repository
+ Open terminal
+ Navigate to the "python-CaesarHacker" folder
```bash
cd pythonProjects/python-CaesarHacker
```
+ Enter "python3 caesarHacker.py"
```bash
# Be sure to type "python3" and not just "python"

python3 caesarHacker.py
```
+ Enjoy!
