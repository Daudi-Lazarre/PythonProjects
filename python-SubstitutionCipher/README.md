# Substitution cipher
This form of encryption has a layer of privacy that caesar cipher does not - it cannot be cracked by our caesar hacker program.
Even though this is the case, the substition cipher, like all forms of cyber security, have a weakness.
In a nutshell, this form of encryption sets a scrambled 26 letter alphabet generation as the key itself.

## How to run the program
To run a program, do the following:
+ Open terminal
+ Navigate to the "python-SubstitutionCipher" folder
```bash
cd pythonProjects/python-SubstitutionCipher
```
+ Enter "python3 substitutionCipher.py"
```bash
# Be sure to type "python3" and not just "python"

python3 substitutionCipher.py
```
+ Enjoy!
